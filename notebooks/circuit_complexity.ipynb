    "Regarding the `gate count` number, it is important to note that the number depends on which gates are counted. If the gates that are added to a circuit during the encoding process are counted directly, the resulting number may be lower than the actual number of gates used in a real quantum computer. That may happen because some gates added during the encoding process are not supported by the `IBM Quantum` machines, such as `ry` gates or `mcry` gates. So, the quantum circuit needs to be transpiled to get the actual number of gates used in a real quantum computer. However, even among the `IBM Quantum` computers, each might support a different set of gates. Moreover, the transpilation process itself differs based on the chosen optimization level. In this Notebook, three different `gate count` calculations are performed:\n",

    "1. Directly counting the gates that are added by the implemented encoding methods and not transpiling created circuits.\n",
    "   \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Counting the gates after transpiling the circuits with the lowest possible optimization level.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This approach is more informative because it takes into account the actual number of gates used when encoding an input in a real quantum computer. During the transpilation process, the lowest possible optimization level is used, meaning that no optimization is performed when transpiling the circuit. All gates are transpiled in the most straightforward way possible, so the `gate count` is highest in this case. This approach tests the worst-case scenario, meaning the resulting `gate count` can only get better regardless of which optimization algorithm is utilized.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Counting the gates after transpiling the circuits with the highest possible optimization level.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This last approach is similar to the second one, but the highest optimization level is chosen when the transpilation is performed. The results can change in the future if the optimization algorithms used in the `Qiskit` library change over time."

    "- Takes as input a list of input vector lengths. It then iterates over this list and generates input vectors of the given lengths. The generated vectors only contain `1` as elements. That is because the basis encoding method only allows binary vectors as inputs. For each `1` it uses an `x` gate, while it uses no gate for `0`. So, having all elements as `1` means the basis encoding method uses the maximum number of gates equal to the length of the input vector. As for the other encoding methods, encoding binary vectors does not utilize their full potential because they can not only encode `0` or `1` but also any real number in the interval $[-1, 1]$. However, the point of this Notebook is to use the implemented encoding methods and compare their complexity, not to use them to encode data in the most efficient way possible. As with the basis encoding method, an input vector only containing `1` as its elements requires the maximum number of gates also in all other encoding methods (because the vector containing only `1` as its elements needs to be normalized in order for it to be encoded using the angle, amplitude, and divide-and-conquer encoding methods). To summarize, input vectors are generated in a way that requires the encoding methods to use the maximum number of gates.\n",

First, small input vectors are used, specifically from the starting length of just one element to the length of 16 elements (creating an even longer table would not be practical).

Regarding these two encoding methods, it may be beneficial to see how the qubit and gate counts scale when using input vectors with even more elements.
